        'number' => 'YOUR_ACTUAL_GCASH_NUMBER', // Replace with your real GCash
        'name' => 'JJ Flower Shop'
    ],
    'paymaya' => [
        'number' => 'YOUR_ACTUAL_PAYMAYA_NUMBER', // Replace with your real PayMaya
        'name' => 'JJ Flower Shop'
    ],
    'bank_transfer' => [
        'number' => 'YOUR_ACTUAL_BANK_ACCOUNT', // Replace with your real bank account
        'name' => 'JJ Flower Shop',
        'bank' => 'BDO' // Update with your bank name
    ],
    'ewallet' => [
        'number' => 'YOUR_ACTUAL_EWALLET_NUMBER', // Replace with your real e-wallet
